# Introduction  
*Welcome to Ironreach*

This repository contains the living lore for **The Forge**, a serious roleplay universe built on the Helix platform and grounded in the landlocked state of **Ironreach**.

Ironreach is not a backdrop.  
It is a system.

Every region, faction, road, and institution exists for a reason. Geography shapes behavior. Economics drive conflict. Power moves through infrastructure, influence, and pressure—not coincidence. Lore is what gives weight to decisions and continuity to stories.

Without lore, a map is just terrain.  
With lore, it becomes a world.

## What We’re Building

The Forge is focused on **cohesive, grounded roleplay**. That means:

- Locations are intentional  
- Factions emerge from environment and necessity  
- Crime has logistics, not magic  
- Law enforcement has limits and jurisdiction  
- Player actions create lasting consequences  

Ironreach is designed to feel believable—modern, pressured, and unequal. Some regions accumulate power. Others absorb its cost. Every storyline should make sense within that structure.

This repository documents that structure.

## Why Lore Matters

Lore provides:
- Context for conflict  
- Meaningful faction identity  
- Consistency across time  
- A shared understanding of the world  

It ensures that when players collide—whether through crime, enforcement, or politics—their actions are grounded in a shared reality.

Lore does not restrict creativity.  
It **focuses** it.

## How This Repository Works

- Content here is considered **canon** once merged  
- Development happens in the open  
- Regions and factions are expanded deliberately  
- Gaps are intentional and will be filled over time  

This is not a finished product. It is a forge—pressure applied slowly, shaping something durable.
