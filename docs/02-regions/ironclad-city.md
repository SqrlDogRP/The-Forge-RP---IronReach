# Ironclad City  
*Where Power Is Cast*

Ironclad City is the center of gravity in Ironreach. It is where money pools, decisions are made, and consequences are distributed outward. Glass towers, corporate campuses, and controlled neighborhoods define the skyline, while influence moves quietly behind closed doors.

Ironclad does not rely on force alone.  
It relies on access.

This is the city where laws are shaped long before they are enforced.

## Regional Identity

Ironclad City is built on concentration—of wealth, authority, and opportunity. Everything here is designed to be efficient, presentable, and controlled. Public order is maintained not through visibility, but through systems.

Those without access quickly learn where they are not welcome.

**Defining Traits**
- Corporate dominance  
- Controlled environments  
- High surveillance density  
- Extreme economic disparity  

Ironclad does not need loyalty. It expects compliance.

- **Corporate Campus Zone** – Secured developments and private transit  
- **Luxury Residential** – Gated communities and high-rise living

Movement between districts is easy—access within them is not.

Ironclad City is the forge itself.

Pressure is applied here. Systems are shaped here. Everything else in Ironreach reacts to what happens within this city.

Dustwater absorbs.

**Ironclad decides.**
