# Hollow Point  
*Where Ironreach Is Fed and Forgotten*

Hollow Point lies at the center of Ironreach’s rural heartland. It is a region of farmland, processing plants, and aging towns that keep the state running while remaining largely unseen. Crops are grown, livestock is processed, and materials are refined here—then shipped elsewhere for profit.

Hollow Point produces value.  
It rarely keeps it.

The region exists in the shadow of Ironclad’s wealth and Crosswind’s movement, quietly absorbing the cost of both.

## Regional Identity

Hollow Point is built on work, endurance, and resentment. Generations have lived and died in the same towns, watching opportunity leave with every shipment that rolls down the highway.

The people here do not expect help. They expect to endure.

**Defining Traits**
- Agricultural and industrial focus  
- Aging infrastructure  
- Limited upward mobility

Hollow Point survives because it has to.

### Competing Forces

## Criminal Ecosystem

Crime in Hollow Point grows from pressure.

- Local PDs struggle with staffing  
- State resources arrive late, if at all  
- Community ties complicate enforcement  

Justice is often negotiated before it is enforced.

## Culture & Daily Life

Life in Hollow Point is slow, routine, and close-knit.

- Long workdays and early mornings  
- Strong family and social networks  
- Deep skepticism of outsiders  
- Pride mixed with fatigue  

People here measure time in harvests, shifts, and layoffs.

---

## Roleplay Themes

Hollow Point supports:

- Rural and small-town law enforcement RP  
- Labor disputes and plant-related conflict  
- Grassroots crime and gang recruitment  
- Community-driven storylines  
- Moral gray areas and personal stakes  

This is a region where **choices are shaped by necessity**.

## Narrative Role in Ironreach

Hollow Point is Ironreach’s backbone.

When systems fail elsewhere, the cost lands here. When profits rise elsewhere, this region sees little of it.

Ironclad decides.  
Crosswind moves.  
Dustwater disappears things.  
Eastmere secures secrets.  

**Hollow Point endures.**

## What Comes Next

Hollow Point’s depth will continue to unfold.

As Ironreach grows, the following elements will be expanded:

- Named towns and industrial centers  
- Major employers and landholding families  
- Local gangs and recruitment pipelines  
- Sheriff jurisdictions and community power structures  
- Historical events that shaped regional resentment  

Hollow Point doesn’t ask to be noticed.  
But when pressure builds long enough, something always breaks.
