# Westlake Expanse  
*Where Wealth Floats*

Westlake Expanse surrounds Ironreach’s western great lake, a vast inland body of water that draws wealth, tourism, and discretion in equal measure. The shoreline shifts from manicured resorts to secluded coves, from luxury estates to neglected marinas.

Westlake is marketed as escape.  
In reality, it is insulation.

Money comes here to relax, to hide, and to be cleaned.

## Narrative Role in Ironreach

Westlake Expanse is Ironreach’s filter.

When wealth becomes too visible or too dirty, it flows here—circulates quietly—and returns sanitized.

Ironclad decides.  
Crosswind moves.  
Dustwater absorbs.  
Redwood conceals.  
Eastmere secures.  
Hollow Point endures.  

**Westlake cleans.**

Westlake appears calm on the surface.  
What moves beneath it rarely is.
