# Blackwake MC  

*Nothing Moves on the Water Unseen*

**Primary Territory:** Westlake Expanse  
**Faction Type:** Outlaw Motorcycle Club  
**Disposition:** Adaptive, profit-driven, discreet  

Blackwake MC controls the water of Ironreach.

Where Ironwood Brotherhood roots itself in land and isolation, Blackwake thrives on movement, access, and opportunity. Born from marina work, seasonal labor, and transient lake traffic, Blackwake evolved into a highly flexible organization that understands one simple truth:

Water hides mistakes better than land ever could.

Blackwake does not dominate territory through force.  
They dominate **routes**, **timing**, and **information**.

## Origins

Blackwake began as a loose riding collective tied to dock workers, mechanics, and transport crews operating around Westlake Expanse. Early members worked seasonal jobs, maintained boats, and moved equipment for wealthy outsiders who rarely asked questions.

Over time, Blackwake learned which questions not to ask—and which ones to sell answers to.

As tourism expanded and money poured into Westlake, Blackwake positioned itself between wealth and access. What started as convenience became leverage.

They did not need to build power.  
They floated on it.

## Identity & Philosophy

Blackwake MC is a business first and a brotherhood second.

They value:
- Adaptability over tradition  
- Profit over ideology  
- Loyalty within the club, flexibility outside it  
- Discretion above all  

Blackwake does not chase attention. Attention brings regulation.

**Core Beliefs**
- Control access, not people  
- Blend in until it matters  
- Never disrupt the season  
- Reputation is currency  

Blackwake survives by staying useful.

## Territory & Influence

Blackwake influence extends across:
- Marinas and boat launches  
- Resort docks and private slips  
- Shoreline access routes  
- Watercraft repair and storage facilities  

They do not claim every shoreline openly. Instead, they maintain **informal control** through relationships, contracts, and quiet pressure.

If someone launches without Blackwake knowing, it is noticed.

## Organizational Structure

Blackwake operates with looser hierarchy than Ironwood, but discipline
