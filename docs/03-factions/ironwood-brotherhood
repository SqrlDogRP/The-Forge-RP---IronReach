# Ironwood Brotherhood  
*Keepers of the Reach*

**Primary Territory:** Redwood Reach  
**Faction Type:** Outlaw Motorcycle Club  
**Disposition:** Territorial, insular, disciplined  

The Ironwood Brotherhood is one of the oldest and most entrenched outlaw groups in Ironreach. Long before Ironclad consolidated power and before Crosswind moved at scale, Ironwood riders were already carving routes through the highlands.

They did not arrive to conquer Redwood Reach.  
They **endured it**—and claimed it by surviving where others failed.

To Ironwood, the mountains and forests are not hiding places. They are home.

## Origins

The Ironwood Brotherhood traces its roots to displaced loggers, mill workers, and veterans who were pushed out of legitimate industry as automation and consolidation stripped Redwood Reach of work.

What began as a riding club built around shared hardship evolved into a tightly structured brotherhood bound by loyalty, silence, and land.

Ironwood was forged during a time when law enforcement rarely ventured into the highlands and corporations saw no value in the terrain. That absence allowed the Brotherhood to establish permanence.

They never left.

## Identity & Philosophy

Ironwood Brotherhood does not see itself as criminal.

They view themselves as:
- Stewards of Redwood Reach  
- Enforcers of local order  
- A barrier against outside exploitation  

They believe authority must be **earned through presence**, not assigned by title.

**Core Beliefs**
- Loyalty outweighs profit  
- Territory is sacred  
- Silence is survival  
- Respect is enforced  

Ironwood does not recruit quickly, and it does not forgive easily.

---

## Territory & Influence

Ironwood controls:
- Forest routes and logging roads  
- Mountain passes and fire trails  
- Remote compounds and camps  
- Abandoned mines and tunnels  

Their influence is strongest where infrastructure weakens and visibility drops. Locals know which roads are watched and which paths are forbidden.

Trespass is tolerated once.  
Defiance is not.

---

## Organizational Structure

Ironwood operates with strict internal hierarchy.

### Known Ranks
- **Elder** – Senior leadership; strategic decisions  
- **Captain** – Territory and crew commanders  
- **Enforcer** – Discipline, protection, and retaliation  
- **Brother** – Full-patched members  
- **Prospect** – Candidates under evaluation  

Promotion is slow. Reputation matters more than numbers.

---

## Operations

Ironwood avoids volume. They favor control.

### Primary Activities
- Forest-route smuggling  
- Weapons storage and transport  
- Protection of off-grid sites  
- Selective enforcement-for-hire  

They do not chase trends. They invest in permanence.

Violence is precise, intentional, and rarely public.

---

## Criminal Code

Ironwood adheres to an internal code that governs all actions:

- No unnecessary attention  
- No harm to local families without cause  
- No cooperation with law enforcement  
- No operations that invite prolonged scrutiny  

Breaking the code carries consequences far worse than arrest.

---

## Relationship with Law Enforcement

Ironwood maintains an adversarial but calculated relationship with authorities.

- Patrols avoid known Ironwood zones  
- Investigations stall in terrain-heavy areas  
- Informal understandings exist with some local sheriffs  

State and federal task forces have attempted infiltration. None have lasted.

Ironwood does not need to threaten law enforcement.  
The land does it for them.

---

## Relationship with Other Factions

### Blackwake MC
- Uneasy neutrality  
- Strict territorial separation  
- Occasional cooperation  
- Long memory of unresolved conflicts  

### Ironclad Interests
- Mutual avoidance  
- Silent acknowledgment of boundaries  

Ironwood does not seek power outside Redwood Reach.  
It defends what it already owns.

---

## Culture & Daily Life

Life inside Ironwood is regimented and austere.

- Members live close to territory  
- Families are protected but isolated  
- Outsiders are never fully trusted  
- Loyalty is tested constantly  

Ironwood does not glorify excess.  
It glorifies survival.

---

## Narrative Role in Ironreach

Ironwood Brotherhood represents **resistance to control**.

When Ironreach expands too aggressively—through development, enforcement, or exploitation—Ironwood is often the first barrier encountered.

They are not loud.  
They are not fast.  

They are **still there** when everyone else leaves.

---

## What Comes Next

Ironwood Brotherhood will be expanded through:

- Named compounds, camps, and strongholds  
- Known leaders and rival figures  
- Historical conflicts and betrayals  
- Law enforcement task force interactions  
- Internal fractures and succession struggles  

Ironwood does not crumble under pressure.

It tightens.

Those who enter Redwood Reach without permission learn that quickly.
