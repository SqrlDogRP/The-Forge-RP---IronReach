# The Forge RP — Ironreach Lore (Canon)

This repository is the living canon for The Forge, a serious roleplay universe built on Helix and set in the landlocked state of Ironreach.

Ironreach is not just a backdrop—it is the foundation. Its regions, power structures, industries, and history shape how every story unfolds. The map is not random. Locations exist for a reason. Factions rise and fall based on geography, economics, and pressure. Lore gives meaning to conflict, consequence to decisions, and continuity to roleplay.

This project is about building a world that feels cohesive, grounded, and believable—where player actions make sense within the setting, and nothing exists “just because it’s fun.”

Lore is what turns a sandbox into a world.

Development happens in the open. Everything here is expanded deliberately, documented clearly, and treated as canon once merged. As Ironreach grows, so does the depth of play inside The Forge.

If you want to help shape this world—regions, factions, tensions, or history—jump into the Discord and get involved. We’re forging this together.
